# fileManager

use tags, colors
enable sorting
enable dynamic-select-script


make a sql-jquery like file manager:

functions like :
 + list the latest-version design file fo all projects
 + all my javascript file
 + ignore program files when searching
 + different folders' file together in one specific place

As to me, not only my desktop is a mess, also be c/d/e/f disks.
I do develope and maintain, when i want to find a diff file while i cannot figure out the exact time, exact location, how ?


what we need to do is :: do a throughout description over each new folder and file, that's info for locating later. Eg. i'm doing a bug-fixing today, i create a folder on desktop and name it `*whatever*it*is*`, create a file old.js to be a backup, and fork a new.js, after finishing fixing, added a readme.md and diff.diff. What's difference from usual is that, you need to descript the folder, add tags, add remarks, select a type(you need to record all types of files that you may have). You may color the folder as yellow.
